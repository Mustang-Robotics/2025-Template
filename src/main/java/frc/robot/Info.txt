2024 Programming Plans

General Commands List:
-Main Arm 
--Rotate Between Two positions
--Stop at any specific location using an encoder
---Buttons for up and down motion
---Uses Talon SRX x1
-ProfiledPID
--RevThroughBoreEncoder
##Usage:
-SetGoal for Specific Positions. Use Specific Buttons

-Intake:
--Base value is a slow pull in.
--PID to rev to full power
--Full Power for initial intake and final shot
---Uses Talon SRX x1
-SubsystemBase
##Usage:


-Shooter:
--Base value is off.
--Full value for on with a PID loop.
---Uses Spark Maxx x2 (Also encoder)
--PID Subsystem
##Usage:

-Climbing Mechanism:
---Uses Talon SRX x1
##Usage:


Questions:
-How does a built-in PID controller/subsystem effect the speed of it's motors?
-is the Rev Through Bore Encoder an absolute encoder? (Arm) I don't know how to use it.
-For the shooter subsystem, is the two max sparks what we want? I can set the speeds to a base speed, but what exactly do you want?
